## Year in college: 5 


## Computing experience:  None. Only know to use SQL via ArcMap


## Mention a topic from biology or any other field that interest you: I am very interested in spatial anylysis since it can be applicable in various fields.  


## Describe what would like to do as a project for this class: I am currently part of a research team and we have a data set that we are sorting and formatting so perhaps learning how to do that more efficiently would be more helpful. Also I am working on my own research project so it would be useful to do some sort of data analysis with my dataset.
